This is a big commit regarding a huge flaw with the model for dealing with an eclipse VFS. Specifically  multiple eclipse file links can in fact point to the same absolute file  so using the absolute file as a key to map backwards to an eclipse-based path is unacceptable and can yield more than one answer.  This commit will cause archives unit test regressions  which I will work on fixing.  git-svn-id: http://svn.jboss.org/repos/jbosstools/trunk@8977 a97e2381-89e5-4abb-bab3-167db6db766c ,0

Refactored for the new TDDoc strategy  now a builder can listen to TDDoc events and create  a structire that is serialized to disc  containing the suits and tests that were run  in the order they were run. Later more information such as serialized dynamic contexts will be made available via this structure. The structure can the subsequently be read and used to generate documentation from the data available via the structure. ,1
Refactored class names so that expressions is the rrot type. Expressions can be built up from single constraints  or any combination of constraints  operators and nested expressions. Currently the following operators are implemented: and (&&) or (||) xor (^) not (!) ,1

performance optimization:  - eliminated BaseFunction.apply + applyInline Template method pattern to keep stack shallow - replaced tracing by bytecode enhancement based tracing. That is no performance overhead if tracing is off.,1
Patch von Salthan (stm) Coordinate --> CoordinateID Ich habe die Klasse Coordinate in CoordinateID umbenannt. Das erzeugt natÃ¼rlich einen Haufen Ã„nderungen  aber erstens ist es analog zur Benennung der anderen Nachkommen von ID (EntityID  UnitID  ...) und zweitens sensibilisiert es kÃ¼nftig Programmierer fÃ¼r das Problem der Verwendung von Koordinaten als SchlÃ¼ssel in Hashtables. Substantiell hat sich aber nichts verÃ¤ndert. Origin Transformation: io.cr.CRParser kann jetzt so verwendet werden  dass er den Report gleich beim Einlesen im Koordinatensystem verschiebt. cr.Loader/io.GameDataReader kann dadurch einen Report verschoben klonen. util.ReportMerger verwendet dies wiederum  um Reporte zusammenzufÃ¼gen  ebenso wie demo.SetOrigin und swing.contextMapContextMenu. AuÃŸerdem verhÃ¤lt sich der ReportMerger jetzt eine Nuance intelligenter beim ZusammenfÃ¼gen. DafÃ¼r flog placeOrigin(...) in GameData raus. Und noch was ganz anderes: SplitSets-Reihenfolge (com.eressea.demo.desktop.MagellanDesktop) Beim Einlesen der Splitsets aus der desktop.ini-Datei werden die Splitsets jetzt in der Reihenfolge eingefÃ¼gt  wie sie in der Datei stehen und nicht mehr willkÃ¼rlich  wie bisher. Und zuletzt habe ich die Methode parseBuilding in io.cr.CRParser noch gefixt  das war mir im Zusammenhang mit dem TraumschlÃ¶sschen-Bug aufgefallen. ,0

Implemented sending of mark events so that from(id) to(id) constructs are availabelï¿½ on  a codeblock. ,0
Implemented references. References gives greater flexibility when it comes to describing refernced objects. IE if an expresison is refereced you want to pass the describer to the expression (expression.describeWith(describer) but when a regular object is referenced you want to describe it directly with describer.describeReference(object.toString()). References makes this possible by changing the reference type. ,1
