this program read the data from a csv file and then reasmple it using diffrent resampling methods using
libraries from (https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn)
and feed it to diffrent classifiers using libraries from (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

the results are discussed in the paper "Classifying Commit Messages: A Case Study in Resampling Techniques"

to run this code you need python 3, scikit-learn library and imbalanced-learn module. the easiest way to setup everything is to use Anaconda "https://www.continuum.io/"
