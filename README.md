The main project was created in gitlab (https://gitlab.com/ensemble-classifiers/fourd-python)


This program read the data from a csv file and then reasmple it using diffrent resampling methods from (https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn) and feed it to diffrent classifiers using libraries from (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

The results are discussed in the paper "Classifying Commit Messages: A Case Study in Resampling Techniques" and published in IJCNN 2017 (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7965999/)

To run this code you need python 3, scikit-learn library and imbalanced-learn module. the easiest way to setup everything is to use Anaconda "https://www.continuum.io/"
